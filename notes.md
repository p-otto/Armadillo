- only choreography tasks are handled on chain
- state and behavior are often encapsulated into different contracts
- on-chain, control/validate accesses that happen off-chain
- deploying a contract = creating a new contract instance; on the blockchain, there are only objects, not classes
- process control flow contracts should selfdestruct at the end
