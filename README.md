## Abstract
Lack of trust between communication partners is one of the major issues companies face when implementing business processes in a cross-organizational setting.
Blockchain is an emerging technology that enables decentralization and distribution of state without the need for a trusted central instance.
As a result, it is possible to form consensus in the communication between otherwise untrusting parties.
In this paper we introduce Armadillo, an open-source prototype implementation for realizing business process choreographies using the Ethereum blockchain.
We present a smart contract system for inter-process communication, as well as a user interface for connecting business processes and smart contracts.
While our solution is not production-ready in terms of transaction costs, it describes a basis for untrusted messaging via the blockchain without a central controlling party.
