  abstract="Process choreographies are addressed in Chapter 5. After motivating the need for process interactions and process choreographies as means to specify these interactions, development phases during choreography design are introduced. The design and implementation of process choreographies is presented, introducing consistency notions that guide the correct implementation of process choreographies. After introducing service interaction patterns and Let's Dance as concrete notations for specifying choreographies, the respective diagram types provided by the BPMN are addressed. In particular, conversation diagrams and process choreography diagrams of the BPMN are presented and illustrated by a rich set of examples.",
